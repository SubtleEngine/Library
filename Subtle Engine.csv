Usually we equate access to technology with opportunity and the chance to pursue ""the good life."" Power Failure raises some crucial, if disconcerting, questions about technology: If technology liberates us, what kind of liberation does it promise? Are we prospering, and by what definition?  Albert Borgmann looks at the relationship between Christianity and technology by examining some of the ""invisible"" dangers of a technology-driven lifestyle. Specifically, he points out how utility and consumption have replaced connection to physical things and meaningful practices in everyday life. Power Failure calls us to redeem and restrain technology through simple Christian practices, including citizen-based decision making, shared meals, and daily Scripture reading.","2003-06-01","2018-12-30 21:14:34","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","145","","","","","Power Failure","","","","","Baker Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: koUL7eggvT8C","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=koUL7eggvT8C","Technology","Philosophy / Religious","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Believers and unbelievers alike are saturated with technology, yet most give it little if any thought. Consumers buy and upgrade as fast as they can, largely unaware of technology's subtle yet powerful influence. In a world where technology changes almost daily, many are left to wonder: Should Christians embrace all that is happening? Are there some technologies that we need to avoid? Does the Bible give us any guidance on how to use digital tools and social media? An experienced Web developer and writer on technology and culture, John Dyer answers these questions and more by walking through the story of the Bible and introducing key ideas about how technology and culture interact. Dyer first analyzes the biblical, theological, and philosophical foundations of technology and then studies several examples that show how technology can influence the spiritual life. For youth pastors, college-aged readers, and anyone interested in understanding how technology fits with faith, ""From the Garden to the City"" fills a gap for biblically-informed literature in a technological world. ""The burgeoning field of internet possibilities has very little written from a Christian perspective, much less from a gifted artist like John Dyer.""--J. Scott Horrell, Professor of Theological Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary ""Of all the voices speaking and writing on the subject today, John Dyer's is among the voices I most respect.

Our increasingly fast-paced world seems more and more remote from the world narrated in Scripture. But despite its pervasiveness, there remains a dearth of theological reflection about computer technology and what it means to live as a faithful Christian in a digitally-saturated society. In this thoughtful and timely book, Derek Schuurman provides a brief theology of technology, rooted in the Reformed tradition and oriented around the grand themes of creation, fall, redemption and new creation. He combines a concise, accessible style with penetrating cultural and theological analysis. Building on the work of Jacques Ellul, Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, and drawing from a wide range of Reformed thinkers, Schuurman situates computer technology within the big picture of the biblical story. Technology is not neutral, but neither is there an exclusively &quot;Christian&quot; form of technological production and use. Instead, Schuurman guides us to see the digital world as part of God’s good creation, fallen yet redeemable according to the law of God. Responsibly used, technology can become an integral part of God’s shalom for the earth.","2013-05-02","2018-12-30 21:18:09","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","145","","","","","Shaping a Digital World","","","","","InterVarsity Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-m33gBYK8bAC","Technology","Computers / Social Aspects / General; Religion / Christian Theology / Apologetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It's about developing wisdom, character, and courage in the way we use digital media rather than accepting technology's promises of ease, instant gratification, and the world's knowledge at our fingertips. And it's definitely not just about the kids.Drawing on in-depth original research from the Barna Group, Andy Crouch shows readers that the choices we make about technology have consequences we may never have considered. He takes readers beyond the typical questions of what, where, and when and instead challenges them to answer provocative questions like, Who do we want to be as a family? and How does our use of a particular technology move us closer or farther away from that goal?

"IZ5PJTG4","book","2018","Noble, Alan","Disruptive Witness: Speaking Truth in a Distracted Age","","978-0-8308-8109-3","","","","These two trends define life in Western society today. We are increasingly addicted to habits--and devices--that distract and ""buffer"" us from substantive reflection and deep engagement with the world. And we live in what Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor calls ""a secular age""--an age in which all beliefs are equally viable and real transcendence is less and less plausible. Drawing on Taylor's work, Alan Noble describes how these realities shape our thinking and affect our daily lives. Too often Christians have acquiesced to these trends, and the result has been a church that struggles to disrupt the ingrained patterns of people's lives. But the gospel of Jesus is inherently disruptive: like a plow, it breaks up the hardened surface to expose the fertile earth below. In this book Noble lays out individual, ecclesial, and cultural practices that disrupt our society's deep-rooted assumptions and point beyond them to the transcendent grace and beauty of Jesus. Disruptive Witness casts a new vision for the evangelical imagination, calling us away from abstraction and cliché to a more faithful embodiment of the gospel for our day.","2018-07-17","2018-12-30 21:21:08","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","203","","","","","Disruptive Witness","","","","","InterVarsity Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 7e9dDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7e9dDwAAQBAJ","Technology","Religion / Christian Life / Social Issues; Religion / Christian Theology / Apologetics; Religion / Christian Ministry / Evangelism; Religion / Christianity / General; Social Science / Sociology of Religion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"NNE3JGF8","book","2013","Noble, David F.","The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention","","978-0-307-82853-8","","","","Arguing against the widely held belief that technology and religion are at war with each other, David F. Noble's groundbreaking book reveals the religious roots and spirit of Western technology.          It links the technological enthusiasms of the present day with the ancient and enduring Christian expectation of recovering humankind's lost divinity. Covering a period of a thousand years, Noble traces the evolution of the Western idea of technological development from the ninth century, when the useful arts became connected to the concept of redemption, up to the twentieth, when humans began to exercise God-like knowledge and powers.         Noble describes how technological advance accelerated at the very point when it was invested with spiritual significance. By examining the imaginings of monks, explorers, magi, scientists, Freemasons, and engineers, this historical account brings to light an other-worldly inspiration behind the apparently worldly endeavors by which we habitually define Western civilization. Thus we see that Isaac Newton devoted his lifetime to the interpretation of prophecy. Joseph Priestley was the discoverer of oxygen and a founder of Unitarianism. Freemasons were early advocates of industrialization and the fathers of the engineering profession. Wernher von Braun saw spaceflight as a millenarian new beginning for humankind.         The narrative moves into our own time through the technological enterprises of the last half of the twentieth century: nuclear weapons, manned space exploration, Artificial Intelligence, and genetic engineering. Here the book suggests that the convergence of technology and religion has outlived its usefulness, that though it once contributed to human well-being, it has now become a threat to our survival. Viewed at the dawn of the new millennium, the technological means upon which we have come to rely for the preservation and enlargement of our lives betray an increasing impatience with life and a disdainful disregard for mortal needs. David F. Noble thus contends that we must collectively strive to disabuse ourselves of the inherited religion of technology and begin rigorously to re-examine our enchantment with unregulated technological advance.","2013-01-23","2019-01-01 20:42:25","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","339","","","","","The Religion of Technology","","","","","Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: xKIyIiCmyYYC","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xKIyIiCmyYYC","Technology","Religion / Christianity / History; Science / Philosophy & Social Aspects; Technology & Engineering / History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Technology and Religion: Remaining Human in a Co-created World, Noreen Herzfeld examines this and other provocative questions as she provides an accessible and fascinating overview of the relationship between religion and the ever-broadening world of technology. In order to consider fully a topic as wide as technology, Herzfeld approaches the field from three different angles: technologies of the human body—such as genetic engineering, stem cells, cloning, pharmaceutical technologies, mechanical enhancement and cyborgs; technologies of the human mind—like human and artificial intelligence, virtual reality and cyberspace; and technologies of the external environment—such as nanotechnology, genetically modified crops and new agricultural technologies, and energy technology. She takes a similarly broad approach to the field of religion, focusing on how these issues interface with the three Abrahamic traditions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Throughout, readers will find nuanced examinations of the moral and ethical issues surrounding new technologies from the perspectives of these faith traditions. The result is a multifaceted look at the ongoing dialogue between these two subjects that are not commonly associated with one another. This volume is the third title published in the new Templeton Science and Religion Series.","2009-06","2019-01-01 20:45:49","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","177","","","","","Technology and Religion","","","","","Templeton Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IqpybPC_-IcC","Technology","Religion / General; Science / Philosophy & Social Aspects; Religion / Religion & Science; Technology & Engineering / Social Aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Apocalyptic AI, Robert Geraci offers the first serious account of this &quot;cyber-theology&quot; and the people who promote it. Drawing on interviews with roboticists and AI researchers and with devotees of the online game Second Life, among others, Geraci illuminates the ideas of such advocates of Apocalyptic AI as Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil. He reveals that the rhetoric of Apocalyptic AI is strikingly similar to that of the apocalyptic traditions of Judaism and Christianity. In both systems, the believer is trapped in a dualistic universe and expects a resolution in which he or she will be translated to a transcendent new world and live forever in a glorified new body. Equally important, Geraci shows how this worldview shapes our culture. Apocalyptic AI has become a powerful force in modern culture. In this superb volume, he shines a light on this belief system, revealing what it is and how it is changing society.","2010-02-05","2019-01-01 20:46:40","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","336","","","","","Apocalyptic AI","","","","","Oxford University Press, USA","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 0xaV_8pZUzMC","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0xaV_8pZUzMC","Technology","Religion / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet we seem unable to shake a profound unease with the direction of modern technology and its ideological siblings, global capitalism and massive consumption. Philosophers such as Marcuse, Borgmann and especially Heidegger, have developed important analyses of technological society, however in this book David Lewin argues that their ideas have remained limited either by their secular context, or by the narrow conception of religion that they do allow. This study guides the reader along the newly formed paths of the philosophy of technology, arguing that where those paths come to an abrupt end, a religious discourse is needed to articulate the ultimate concerns that drive technological action. It calls for a meditation on the central insight of many religious traditions that, in an ultimate sense, we ‘know not what we do.’ To acknowledge that we know not what we do is the first step towards a theology of technology that draws upon insights from the mystical theological tradition, as well as from recent developments in the continental philosophy of religion.","2010-09-13","2019-01-01 20:47:58","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","265","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge Scholars Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: DYQnBwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DYQnBwAAQBAJ","Technology","Philosophy / General; Religion / Philosophy; Philosophy / Movements / Phenomenology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"3USHGS2R","book","2011","Cole-Turner, Ronald","Transhumanism and Transcendence: Christian Hope in an Age of Technological Enhancement","","978-1-58901-794-8","","","","The timeless human desire to be more beautiful, intelligent, healthy, athletic, or young has given rise in our time to technologies of human enhancement. Athletes use drugs to increase their strength or stamina; cosmetic surgery is widely used to improve physical appearance; millions of men take drugs like Viagra to enhance sexual performance. And today researchers are exploring technologies such as cell regeneration and implantable devices that interact directly with the brain. Some condemn these developments as a new kind of cheating—not just in sports but in life itself—promising rewards without effort and depriving us most of all of what it means to be authentic human beings. “Transhumanists,” on the other hand, reject what they see as a rationalizing of human limits, as if being human means being content forever with underachieving bodies and brains. To be human, they insist, is to be restless with possibilities, always eager to transcend biological limits. As the debate grows in urgency, how should theology respond? Christian theologians recognize truth on both sides of the argument, pointing out how the yearnings of the transhumanists—if not their technological methods—find deep affinities in Christian belief. In this volume, Ronald Cole-Turner has joined seasoned scholars and younger, emerging voices together to bring fresh insight into the technologies that are already reshaping the future of Christian life and hope.","2011-09-29","2019-01-01 20:50:07","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","229","","","","","Transhumanism and Transcendence","","","","","Georgetown University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: b2OQ5nefgOMC","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b2OQ5nefgOMC","Technology","Religion / Christian Theology / Ethics; Medical / Ethics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These questions underscore the fact that the posthuman is a name for the unknown future, and therefore, not a single idea but a jumble of competing visions - some of which may be exciting, some of which may be frightening, and which is which depends on who you are, and what you desire to be. This book aims to clarify current theological and philosophical dialogue on the posthuman by arguing that theologians must pay attention to which form of the posthuman they are engaging, and to demonstrate that a 'posthuman theology' is not only possible, but desirable, when the vision of the posthuman is one which coincides with a theological vision of the human.","2016-05-13","2019-01-01 20:50:43","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","225","","","","","Cyborg Selves","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wBEpDAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wBEpDAAAQBAJ","Technology","Religion / Religion & Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These ""technological futurisms"" have arisen from significant advances in the fields of nanotechnology, biotechnology and information technology and are drawing growing scrutiny from the philosophical and theological communities. This text seeks to contextualize the growing literature on the cultural, philosophical and religious implications of technological growth by considering technological futurisms such as transhumanism in the context of the long historical tradition of technological dreaming. Michael Burdett traces the latent religious sources of our contemporary technological imagination by looking at visionary approaches to technology and the future in seminal technological utopias and science fiction and draws on past theological responses to the technological future with Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Jacques Ellul. Burdett’s argument arrives at a contemporary Christian response to transhumanism based around the themes of possibility and promise by turning to the works of Richard Kearney, Eberhard Jüngel and Jürgen Moltmann. Throughout, the author highlights points of correspondence and divergence between technological futurisms and the Judeo-Christian understanding of the future.","2014-12-05","2019-01-01 20:51:09","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","362","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ZU62BQAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZU62BQAAQBAJ","Technology","Religion / Christian Theology / Eschatology; Religion / Eschatology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machines and gadgets not only weave the fabric of daily life, but more importantly embody philosophical and religious values which shape the contemporary moral vision-a vision that is often at odds with Christian convictions. This book critically examines those values, and offers a framework for how Christian moral theology should be formed and lived-out within the emerging technoculture. Brent Waters argues that technology represents the principal cultural background against which contemporary Christian moral life is formed. Addressing contemporary ethical and religious issues, this book will be of particular interest to students and scholars exploring the ideas of Heidegger, Nietzsche, Grant, Arendt, and Borgmann.","2016-05-23","2019-01-01 20:51:34","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","271","","","","","Christian Moral Theology in the Emerging Technoculture","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: PmY3DAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PmY3DAAAQBAJ","Technology","Religion / Christianity / General; Religion / Ethics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today, in what has been called the beginnings of “the golden age of neuroscience,” laboratory findings claim to offer insights into how the brain “does” morality, even suggesting that it is possible to make people more moral by manipulating their biology. Can “moral bioenhancement”—using technological or pharmaceutical means to boost the morally desirable and remove the morally problematic—bring about a morally improved humanity? In The Myth of the Moral Brain, Harris Wiseman argues that moral functioning is immeasurably complex, mediated by biology but not determined by it. Morality cannot be engineered; there is no such thing as a “moral brain.”Wiseman takes a distinctively interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from philosophy, biology, theology, and clinical psychology. He considers philosophical rationales for moral enhancement, and the practical realities they come up against; recent empirical work, including studies of the cognitive and behavioral effects of oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine; and traditional moral education, in particular the influence of religious thought, belief, and practice. Arguing that morality involves many interacting elements, Wiseman proposes an integrated bio-psycho-social approach to the consideration of moral enhancement. Such an approach would show that, by virtue of their sheer numbers, social and environmental factors are more important in shaping moral functioning than the neurobiological factors with which they are interwoven.","2016-02-19","2019-01-01 20:52:17","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","351","","","","","The Myth of the Moral Brain","","","","","MIT Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ytCaCwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ytCaCwAAQBAJ","Technology","Philosophy / Ethics & Moral Philosophy; Science / Life Sciences / Biology; Science / Life Sciences / Neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NM6ML4MN","book","2017","Midson, Scott A.","Cyborg Theology: Humans, Technology and God","","978-1-78672-295-9","","","","The concept of the cyborg, or cybernetic organism, has led to notably creative explorations of the ambiguous relationship between human beings and technology. In particular, Donna Haraway argued in her famous 1991 ‘Cyborg Manifesto’ that people, since they are so often now detached and separated from nature, have themselves evolved into cyborgs. This striking idea has had considerable influence within critical theory, cultural studies and even science fiction (where it has surfaced, for example, in the Terminator films and in the Borg of the Star Trek franchise). But it is a notion that has had much less currency in theology. In his innovative new book, Scott Midson boldly argues that the deeper nuances of Haraway’s and the cyborg idea can similarly rejuvenate theology, mythology and anthropology. Challenging the damaging anthropocentrism directed towards nature and the non-human in our society, the author reveals – through an imaginative reading of the myth of Eden – how it is now possible for humanity to be at one with the natural world even as it vigorously pursues novel, ‘post-human’, technologies.","2017-10-30","2019-01-01 20:52:51","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","280","","","","","Cyborg Theology","","","","","I.B.Tauris","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: jixADwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jixADwAAQBAJ","Technology","Religion / Theology; Philosophy / Political; Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / Public Policy / Environmental Policy; Religion / Faith; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet magic did not disappear from this new world so much as find itself transposed into new forms, new bodies, and new powers. This paper will explore the implications of this tranposition.  On Marx’s account, a machine is made up of three components: a motor mechanism, a self-moving power which drives the machine as a whole; a transmitting mechanism, which divides and distributes this power; and the tool or working machine. We might, then, read Dionysius’ decidedly un-secular Celestial Hierarchy as the description of a heavenly machine designed, as Agamben suggests, for the government of the world and the generation of surplus value in the form of doxology. The divine eros which generates the Dionysian cosmos originates with God, is passed on by the angelic messengers, who transmit the divine power to the ecclesiastical hierarchy, whose members labour to become fellow workers with God.  As Marx well knew, machines can function as instruments either of domination or of liberation. This paper will bring Dionysius’ account of angelic labour into conversation with contemporary discussions of the machinic transformation of human labour. First, it will think through the relationship of the divine eros and the role of angels as ‘fellow workmen for God’ in dialogue with Frédéric Lordon and Maurizio Lazzarato’s account of the entanglement of machines and desire in contemporary labour. Second, it will bring the ambiguous role of angels in Dionysius’ anthropology to bear on Donna Haraway’s exposition of the utopian possibilities of the figure of the cyborg as a figure for the possible futures of human life and labour. How might Dionysius help us to think postsecular labour anew?","2017","2019-01-05 18:15:30","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-05 18:15:30","240-259","","2","16","","","Machines of Loving Grace","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","hcommons.org","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/UMEH3S4M/Rose - 2017 - Machines of Loving Grace Angels, Cyborgs and Post.pdf; /Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/Z6LNRSFR/hc14351.html","","Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this essay, I explore an often understated reference in conversations on the promises and shortcomings of said technologies: the disposability of the human body. The Catholic tradition, in particular, boasts a rich and extensive collection of teachings on the theology of the body, which addresses, among other things, the significance of the body for human identity, its relationship to the soul, our (restrained) rights and mastery over it, its (proper) uses over the course of life, its relationship with other bodies, the value of its limitations, and its postmortem fate.

Concomitantly, Church institutions and individuals have made crucial contributions to the advance of science and technology, yet despite this practical effort to better human development, Christian theology has been remarkably uninterested in the subject of technology. This lack of interest is no longer tenable; scholars of religion and theologians should seriously engage technology because it is empowering humanity in ways that were previously reserved only for gods. This blind spot has not only hampered the Church’s ability to understand itself and our world, but also impeded the ability of the Church to fulfill its mission.

This paper provides a general framework for classifying the different approaches that are currently being explored in the field of machine ethics and introduces considerations that are missing from the current debate. In particular, law-based codes implemented as external filters for action—which we have named filtered decision making—are proposed as the basis for future developments. The emergence of values as guides for action is discussed, and personal language –together with subjectivity- are indicated as necessary conditions for this development. Last, utilitarian approaches are studied and the importance of objective expression as a requisite for their implementation is stressed. Only values expressed by the programmer in a public language—that is, separate of subjective considerations—can be evolved in a learning machine, therefore establishing the limits of present-day machine ethics.","2017-05","2019-01-15 21:07:13","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-15 21:07:13","100","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/AL2C5H7B/Lumbreras - 2017 - The Limits of Machine Ethics.pdf; /Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/EAH9R7Y3/100.html","","Technology","ethics of machines; learning automata.; theory of mind; values","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cryonics is not accepted by mainstream science, and even if the vision is never realized, it is worth the effort to use it as a thought experiment to test the capability of the Christian theological system to address this issue in the unfolding new world of human enhancement. Drawing on the apostle Paul, whose view was based in the Jewish notion of psychosomatic unity, Christian resurrection includes emphases on physicality, radical transformation, and continuity of personal identity. Successful cryonics scenarios can include restoring a person to more or less the same life they had before or, more likely, utilize robotics, tissue regeneration, and other future advances in human enhancement technology to restore one to an enhanced state. Christian resurrection and the more likely cryonics scenario both entail physicality, radical transformation, and continuity of personal identity and, as such, can be understood to be technological expressions of Christian resurrection.","2017-05","2019-01-15 21:09:36","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-15 21:09:36","96","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/2MWZPXA5/Mercer - 2017 - Resurrection of the Body and Cryonics.pdf; /Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/HDYJ5ESU/96.html","","Technology","resurrection; body; Christian theology; cryonics; dualism; immortality of the soul; personal identity; superintelligence; uploading; whole brain emulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various technologies are used to protect humans from what are perceived to be the capricious whims of indifferent natural forces. Additionally, technology is used to create circumstances and opportunities that are believed to be preferable because they are more subject to human control. In large measure, the lives of late moderns are effectively constructed and asserted as artifacts of what they will themselves to be. This control is seen prominently at the beginning and end of life. Technology is employed to overcome infertility, prevent illness, disability, and undesirable traits, to select desirable traits and increasingly enhance them. At the end of life, late moderns have a far greater range of options at their disposal than past generations: they can choose to delay death, control pain, or end their lives at the time and with the means of their choosing. The greater control that technology offers helps humans to survive and even flourish, but it comes at a price. One such cost is that it tends to reduce humans to being little more than a will confined within a body. The body is thereby effectively perceived to be an impediment to the will that should be overcome. Is this troubling? Yes. I argue that the purported control technology offers often serves as a distraction or blind spot that may prevent humans from understanding and consenting to their good. In making this argument I draw upon the Christian doctrine of the incarnation as a way of disclosing the creaturely good of finitude against which the will should conform rather than attempting to overcome. I also draw upon Iris Murdoch’s and Simone Weil’s concept of “unselfing” as a way of conforming the will with this good. I revisit issues related to the beginning and end of life to draw-out some of the implications of my argument.","2017-05","2019-01-15 21:10:46","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-15 21:10:46","90","","5","8","","","Willful Control and Controlling the Will","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/5ZHLXUUR/Waters - 2017 - Willful Control and Controlling the Will Technolo.pdf; /Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/Y85PJ37U/90.html","","Technology","technology; George Grant; Hannah Arendt; Iris Murdoch; mastery; ontology; will","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When considering the increase in the power of computers, and their ever-more widespread use over recent decades, concerns have been raised about the social impact of computers and about practical issues arising from their use: the manner in which data is harvested, the preservation of confidentiality where people’s personal information is concerned, the security of systems in which such data is stored, and so on. With the arrival of “big data” new ethical concerns surrounding computer-based technology arise—concerns connected not only with social issues, and with the generation of data and its security, but also with its interpretation by data scientists, and with the burgeoning trade in personal data. The first aim of this paper is to introduce some of these ethical issues, and the second is to suggest some possible ways in which they might be addressed. The latter includes some explorations of the ways in which insights from religious and theological perspectives might be valuable. It is urged that theology and data science might engage in mutually-beneficial dialogue.","2017-05","2019-01-15 21:12:41","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-15 21:12:41","88","","5","8","","","Big Data, Ethics and Religion","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/SERDYVZC/Fuller - 2017 - Big Data, Ethics and Religion New Questions from .pdf; /Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/JIX4D554/88.html","","Technology","ethics; big data; computing; consent; hermeneutics; hippocratic oath; interpretation; privacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using information from psychology, history of religions, and history of science, the perspective proposed is that of a parallel historical analogous development of both religious and scientific attitudes of awe by the use of artifacts carrying two functions: firstly, to coagulate social participation around questions dealing with humanity’s destiny and interpersonal relationships across communities, and secondly to offer cultural coherence through a communal sense of social stability, comfort, and security. I argue that, though animated by attitudes of awe (“awefull”), both leading scientists and religious founders have encountered the difficulty in representing and introducing this awe to the large public via “awesome” artifacts. The failure to represent coherently the initial awe via artifacts may give rise to “anomalous awefullness”: intolerance, persecutions, global conflicts.","2017-05","2019-01-15 21:13:30","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-15 21:13:30","85","","5","8","","","Awe and Artifacts","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/IIJR8WZX/Untea - 2017 - Awe and Artifacts Religious and Scientific Endeav.pdf; /Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/YLCK5ZRG/85.html","","Technology","hierophany; icons and scientific images; scientific and religious awe; the sacred","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Next, an intersectional Christian theo-ethical lens focusing on humans as divine image-bearers is used to generate critical insights regarding the influence of extreme individualism on approaches to moral bioenhancement. This alternative lens emphasizes the interdependence of life, and the contextual character of moral dispositions. The questions of what it means to be creatures bearing the imago dei and making moral choices, is at the center of this exploration. The author concludes that while there may be justifiable exceptions, for now moral bioenhancements are unwarranted.

In seeking freedom from the constraints of nature, it resembles ancient Gnosticism, but complicates the question of what the human being is. In contrast to the perspective that we are our brains, I argue that human consciousness and subjectivity originate from complex interactions between the body and the surrounding environment. These qualities emerge from a distinct set of structural couplings embodied within multiple organ systems and the multiplicity of connections within the brain. These connections take on different forms, including structural, chemical, and electrical manifestations within the totality of the human body. This embodiment suggests that human consciousness, and the intricate levels of experience that accompany it, cannot be replicated in non-organic forms such as computers or synaptic implants without a significant loss to human identity. The Gnostic desire to escape our embodiment found in transhumanism carries the danger of dissolving the human being.","2017-05","2019-01-15 21:15:43","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-15 21:15:43","81","","5","8","","","The Disappearing Human","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/CF4QZTPZ/Pugh - 2017 - The Disappearing Human Gnostic Dreams in a Transh.pdf; /Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/AKUMYX6S/81.html","","Technology","transhumanism; technology; AI; emergence; Gnosticism; Kurzweil; Merleau-Ponty; Singularity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using examples such as “Earthrise” and the UN’s International Treaty on Outer Space, I argue that an immanent understanding of “the other” renegotiates how we understand our embeddedness within the rest of the evolving planetary community.

Today, the transhumanist goal of mind uploading is perceived by many theologians and philosophers to be dangerous due to its violation of the human person. I contrast transhumanist “patternist” views of the person with Brent Waters’s Augustinian view of the technological pilgrim, Celia Deane-Drummond’s evolutionary Thomistic view of humanity, and Francis Fukuyama’s insistence on the inviolability of “Factor X”. These latter three thinkers all disagree with the patternist position, but their views are also discordant with each other. This disagreement constitutes a challenge for people of faith confronting transhumanism—which view is to be taken right? I contend that Science, Technology and Society (STS) studies can enrich our understanding of the debates by highlighting the transmutation of philosophical view into scientific theory and the intermingled nature of our forms of knowledge. Furthermore, I contend that STS helps Christians understand the evolution of their own anthropologies and suggests some prospects for future theological anthropology.","2017-04","2019-01-15 21:17:29","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-15 21:17:29","52","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/AMZEEIEI/Checketts - 2017 - New Technologies—Old Anthropologies.pdf; /Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/5P39A6J3/52.html","","Technology","transhumanism; theological anthropology; consciousness uploading; philosophical anthropology; Science; Technology and Society studies (STS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is argued that an understanding of the full implications of our evolutionary past in conjunction with the Irenaean theodicy provides us with the best answer to these challenges. The traditional Irenaean theodicy emphasizes the importance of education for soul building. Soul building can benefit from technologically enhancing the biological superstructure of our humanity. In particular, genetic engineering can enhance human virtue. The biological basis of our moral natures can be improved using genetic technologies, including (possibly) somatic and germline engineering. To plan for virtue-first enhancement—the Genetic Virtue Project, which focuses on genetic improvements to our moral natures—is of paramount importance for the neo-Irenaean theodicy.","2018-07-03","2019-01-15 21:24:59","2019-01-17 18:44:50","2019-01-15 21:24:59","251-272","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","/Users/jamie/Zotero/storage/PE94UA4N/14746700.2018.html","","Technology","genetic engineering; genetic virtue; Irenaeus; John Hick; play God; problem of evil; theodicy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most importantly for this discussion, Walker proceeds to propose Genetic-First-Enhancement as part of his neo-Irenaean theodicy formulation. Overall, there are two major concerns I raised: the impossibility of a gradient morality in the presence of free will, and the scientific impossibility of Genetic Virtue Program.

While re-creating ourselves genetically to eliminate aggressive acts is not insignificant, such interventions constitute a starting point, not the endpoint, of living a meaningful life in relation to God. Bernard Lonergan’s notion of moral agency requires moral conversion and religious conversion, neither of which could be achieved through gene expression alone. Conversion requires free and intentional participation in moral character development.

In the future, perhaps even alien species and intelligent robots will coexist right alongside humans, who will grapple with challenges and emerge as the heroes. But the truth is that radical technological change has the power to radically shape humans as well. We must be well informed and thoughtful about the steps we're already taking toward a transhuman or even posthuman future. Can we find firm footing on a slippery slope? Biblical ethicist Jacob Shatzer guides us into careful consideration of the future of Christian discipleship in a disruptive technological environment. InTranshumanism and the Image of God, Shatzer explains the development and influence of the transhumanist movement, which promotes a ""next stage"" in human evolution. Exploring topics such as artificial intelligence, robotics, medical technology, and communications tools, he examines how everyday technological changes have already altered and continue to change the way we think, relate, and understand reality. Cautioning against the belief that Christians can easily direct any technology toward following Christ, Shatzer grapples with the potential for technology to transform the way we think about what it means to be human and what sort of future we hope for. By exploring the doctrine of the incarnation and its implications for human identity, he helps us better understand the proper place of technology in the life of the disciple and avoid false promises of a posthumanist vision. What sorts of practices today can help us retain the best of what it means to be human in the future?","2019-04-09","2019-01-16 05:42:25","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","book","","","","","Transhumanism and the Image of God","","","","","InterVarsity Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ZncavQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZncavQEACAAJ","Technology","Technology & Engineering / Social Aspects; Religion / Christian Theology / Ethics; Social Science / Media Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Craig Gay raises concerns about the theological implications of modern  technologies and of philosophical movements such as transhumanism. In  response, he turns to a classical affirmation of the Christian faith:  Jesus Christ, the eternal Word of God, took on human flesh. By exploring  the doctrine of the incarnation and what it means for our embodiment,  Gay offers a course correction to the path of modern technology without  asking us to unplug completely.

"IY9DDLYZ","book","2007","Swearengen, Jack Clayton","Beyond Paradise: Technology and the Kingdom of God","","978-1-4982-7503-3","","","","Technology is shaping our culture and controlling our lives -- for better or for worse. Often, technology&#39;s benefits far outweigh its negative impacts, and technological advances can seem boundless. But the scientific-technological worldview tends to override other value systems. Indeed, this technological way of thinking has influenced many contemporary ideas, beliefs, values, habits, and ways of communicating. Furthermore, in addition to technology&#39;s well-known environmental impacts, social, aesthetic, and spiritual consequences are now emerging. How can we balance positive physical effects of technology with other ambiguous or negative impacts?   Some of the decisions we face have no precedent from which to draw wisdom. For this reason, the resources of Scripture and the Christian tradition must be brought to bear on technological questions: How is technology used and abused today? Does technological progress lead to human progress? How can Scripture help us, both individually and collectively, to manage technology&#39;s impact in proactive ways?   Swearengen uncovers a comprehensive scriptural mandate for managing technology. On his way to a theology of technology, he evaluates which advances are moving society in directions consistent with God&#39;s purposes. Beyond Paradise: Technology and the Kingdom of God aims to provide practical means for assessing technology&#39;s influence and for steering technology and its effects toward biblical ends.","2007-03-01","2019-01-16 20:40:17","2019-01-17 18:44:50","","","365","","","","","Beyond Paradise","","","","","Wipf and Stock Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: t9jPDAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t9jPDAAAQBAJ","Technology","Religion / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
