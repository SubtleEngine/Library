It is argued that an understanding of the full implications of our evolutionary past in conjunction with the Irenaean theodicy provides us with the best answer to these challenges. The traditional Irenaean theodicy emphasizes the importance of education for soul building. Soul building can benefit from technologically enhancing the biological superstructure of our humanity. In particular, genetic engineering can enhance human virtue. The biological basis of our moral natures can be improved using genetic technologies, including (possibly) somatic and germline engineering. To plan for virtue-first enhancement\u2014the Genetic Virtue Project, which focuses on genetic improvements to our moral natures\u2014is of paramount importance for the neo-Irenaean theodicy.", "URL": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2018.1488472", "DOI": "10.1080/14746700.2018.1488472", "ISSN": "1474-6700", "author": [{"family": "Walker", "given": "Mark"}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2018", 7, 3]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}, "keyword": ["Technology"]}
