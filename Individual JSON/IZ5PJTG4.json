    "abstract": "These two trends define life in Western society today. We are increasingly addicted to habits--and devices--that distract and \"buffer\" us from substantive reflection and deep engagement with the world. And we live in what Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor calls \"a secular age\"--an age in which all beliefs are equally viable and real transcendence is less and less plausible. Drawing on Taylor's work, Alan Noble describes how these realities shape our thinking and affect our daily lives. Too often Christians have acquiesced to these trends, and the result has been a church that struggles to disrupt the ingrained patterns of people's lives. But the gospel of Jesus is inherently disruptive: like a plow, it breaks up the hardened surface to expose the fertile earth below. In this book Noble lays out individual, ecclesial, and cultural practices that disrupt our society's deep-rooted assumptions and point beyond them to the transcendent grace and beauty of Jesus. Disruptive Witness casts a new vision for the evangelical imagination, calling us away from abstraction and clich\u00e9 to a more faithful embodiment of the gospel for our day.",
