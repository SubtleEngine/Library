Cryonics is not accepted by mainstream science, and even if the vision is never realized, it is worth the effort to use it as a thought experiment to test the capability of the Christian theological system to address this issue in the unfolding new world of human enhancement. Drawing on the apostle Paul, whose view was based in the Jewish notion of psychosomatic unity, Christian resurrection includes emphases on physicality, radical transformation, and continuity of personal identity. Successful cryonics scenarios can include restoring a person to more or less the same life they had before or, more likely, utilize robotics, tissue regeneration, and other future advances in human enhancement technology to restore one to an enhanced state. Christian resurrection and the more likely cryonics scenario both entail physicality, radical transformation, and continuity of personal identity and, as such, can be understood to be technological expressions of Christian resurrection.", "URL": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/8/5/96", "DOI": "10.3390/rel8050096", "language": "en", "author": [{"family": "Mercer", "given": "Calvin"}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2017", 5]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}}
