We rely upon computers, cell phones, and the Internet for communication, commerce, and entertainment. Yet even though we live in this \u201cinstant message\u201d culture, many of us feel disconnected, and we question if all this technology is really good for our souls.In a manner that\u2019s accessible, thoughtful, and biblical, author Tim Challies addresses questions such as:\u2022 How has life\u2014and faith\u2014changed now that everyone is available all the time through mobile phones?\u2022 How does our constant connection to these digital devices affect our families and our church communities?\u2022 What does it mean that almost two billion humans are connected by the Internet \u2026 with hundreds of millions more coming online each year?Providing the reader with a framework they can apply to any technology, Tim Challies explains how and why our society has become reliant on digital technology, what it means for our lives, and how it impacts the Christian faith.",
