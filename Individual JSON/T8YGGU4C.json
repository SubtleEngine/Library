From the plow to the printing press, technology has always shaped human  life and informed our understanding of what it means to be human. And  advances in modern technology, from computers to smartphones, have  yielded tremendous benefits. But do these developments actually  encourage human flourishing? Craig Gay raises concerns about the theological implications of modern  technologies and of philosophical movements such as transhumanism. In  response, he turns to a classical affirmation of the Christian faith:  Jesus Christ, the eternal Word of God, took on human flesh. By exploring  the doctrine of the incarnation and what it means for our embodiment,  Gay offers a course correction to the path of modern technology without  asking us to unplug completely. Gay demonstrates that the doctrine of the incarnation is not neutral  either. It presents us an alternative vision for the future of humanity.", "ISBN": "978-0-8308-7384-5", "note": "Google-Books-ID: _dJ2DwAAQBAJ", "shortTitle": "Modern Technology and the Human Future", "language": "en", "author": [{"family": "Gay", "given": "Craig M."}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2018", 12, 11]]}, "keyword": ["Technology"]}
