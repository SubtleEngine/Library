It is, however, difficult to discern what they are. Much of the specifically Christian response to transhumanist biotechnological enhancement has revolved around the metaphysics of human persons; this is hardly surprising, given that similar themes appear in other bioethical themes, such as over in vitro fertilization, abortion, and euthanasia. The main aim of this paper is to clarify the theological requirements for such responses, particularly those that are mistakenly delegated to scientists. In particular, the paper will focus on the need for a Christian theological account of human nature that does not unduly rely on biological accounts of the same.", "URL": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2018.1488527", "DOI": "10.1080/14746700.2018.1488527", "ISSN": "1474-6700", "author": [{"family": "Jong", "given": "Jonathan"}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2018", 7, 3]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}, "keyword": ["Technology"]}
