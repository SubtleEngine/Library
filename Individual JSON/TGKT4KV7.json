As a result, the familiar technologies we interact with every day will be viewed differently. The paper will provide a theoretical foundation rooted in the Bible along with a variety of other scholarly sources. The integration of faith and technology described will enable a more critical evaluation of technology, thus making it more likely that technology enables productivity without enslaving its owner and ensuring that one\u2019s allegiance is not to a technological deity but to Jesus Christ. While this paper is focused on bringing a biblical perspective to the area of technology, the principles are applicable to other disciplines as well.", "author": [{"family": "Whiting", "given": "Stephen"}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2011"]]}}
