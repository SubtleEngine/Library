When considering the increase in the power of computers, and their ever-more widespread use over recent decades, concerns have been raised about the social impact of computers and about practical issues arising from their use: the manner in which data is harvested, the preservation of confidentiality where people\u2019s personal information is concerned, the security of systems in which such data is stored, and so on. With the arrival of \u201cbig data\u201d new ethical concerns surrounding computer-based technology arise\u2014concerns connected not only with social issues, and with the generation of data and its security, but also with its interpretation by data scientists, and with the burgeoning trade in personal data. The first aim of this paper is to introduce some of these ethical issues, and the second is to suggest some possible ways in which they might be addressed. The latter includes some explorations of the ways in which insights from religious and theological perspectives might be valuable. It is urged that theology and data science might engage in mutually-beneficial dialogue.", "URL": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/8/5/88", "DOI": "10.3390/rel8050088", "shortTitle": "Big Data, Ethics and Religion", "language": "en", "author": [{"family": "Fuller", "given": "Michael"}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2017", 5]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}, "keyword": ["Technology"]}
