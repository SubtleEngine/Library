Today, the transhumanist goal of mind uploading is perceived by many theologians and philosophers to be dangerous due to its violation of the human person. I contrast transhumanist \u201cpatternist\u201d views of the person with Brent Waters\u2019s Augustinian view of the technological pilgrim, Celia Deane-Drummond\u2019s evolutionary Thomistic view of humanity, and Francis Fukuyama\u2019s insistence on the inviolability of \u201cFactor X\u201d. These latter three thinkers all disagree with the patternist position, but their views are also discordant with each other. This disagreement constitutes a challenge for people of faith confronting transhumanism\u2014which view is to be taken right? I contend that Science, Technology and Society (STS) studies can enrich our understanding of the debates by highlighting the transmutation of philosophical view into scientific theory and the intermingled nature of our forms of knowledge. Furthermore, I contend that STS helps Christians understand the evolution of their own anthropologies and suggests some prospects for future theological anthropology.", "URL": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/8/4/52", "DOI": "10.3390/rel8040052", "language": "en", "author": [{"family": "Checketts", "given": "Levi"}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2017", 4]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}}
