This seemed like an issue for the far future given the unique challenges. Walker focused on the wrong aspect of personhood, however, as moral engineering of the brain appears to be a more likely possibility. As early aspects of moral engineering the brain are in development, especially through the manipulation of the neural correlates of religious and political beliefs, emotions, and behaviors, I consider several issues surrounding this project so as to protect individual rights and prevent future harms. I advance an internal criterion for the field called Acceptability Across Ideologies to serve as a guide to protect against coercive and harmful technologies and analyze how current laws protecting cognitive liberty are lacking and in need of revision.", "URL": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2018.1488476", "DOI": "10.1080/14746700.2018.1488476", "ISSN": "1474-6700", "author": [{"family": "Weissenbacher", "given": "Alan"}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2018", 7, 3]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}, "keyword": ["Technology"]}
