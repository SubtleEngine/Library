As such, these technologies help serve to reify certain human lives at the expense of others. I argue that such exceptionalism depends upon an understanding of transcendence that is totally other. Using examples such as \u201cEarthrise\u201d and the UN\u2019s International Treaty on Outer Space, I argue that an immanent understanding of \u201cthe other\u201d renegotiates how we understand our embeddedness within the rest of the evolving planetary community. As part of renegotiating a planetary anthropology, we must also begin rethinking technologies as for the planet (not just for humans).", "URL": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/8/4/65", "DOI": "10.3390/rel8040065", "shortTitle": "Incarnating the Unknown", "language": "en", "author": [{"family": "Bauman", "given": "Whitney A."}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2017", 4]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}}
