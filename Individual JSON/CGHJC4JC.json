Next, an intersectional Christian theo-ethical lens focusing on humans as divine image-bearers is used to generate critical insights regarding the influence of extreme individualism on approaches to moral bioenhancement. This alternative lens emphasizes the interdependence of life, and the contextual character of moral dispositions. The questions of what it means to be creatures bearing the imago dei and making moral choices, is at the center of this exploration. The author concludes that while there may be justifiable exceptions, for now moral bioenhancements are unwarranted. Moral improvement will be better achieved through more effective educational strategies, and possibly spiritual enhancements, that are geared toward appreciation for the interdependence of all life.", "URL": "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/8/5/84", "DOI": "10.3390/rel8050084", "shortTitle": "Moral Bioenhancement through An Intersectional Theo-Ethical Lens", "language": "en", "author": [{"family": "Trothen", "given": "Tracy J."}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2017", 5]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}}
