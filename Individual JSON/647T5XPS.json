After exposing the Achilles heel of the traditional free-will defense, Walker develops the Irenaean and Augustinian responses to the anthropic problem. Most importantly for this discussion, Walker proceeds to propose Genetic-First-Enhancement as part of his neo-Irenaean theodicy formulation. Overall, there are two major concerns I raised: the impossibility of a gradient morality in the presence of free will, and the scientific impossibility of Genetic Virtue Program. However, my claims are falsifiable if future genetic modifications do indeed improve morality. Before that is proven, I agree with Walker that, yes, we should play God, albeit, with his proposed virtue-first program.", "URL": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2018.1488473", "DOI": "10.1080/14746700.2018.1488473", "ISSN": "1474-6700", "shortTitle": "Genetic Virtue Program", "author": [{"family": "Gouw", "given": "Arvin M."}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2018", 7, 3]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}, "keyword": ["Technology"]}
