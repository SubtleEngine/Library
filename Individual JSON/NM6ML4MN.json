In particular, Donna Haraway argued in her famous 1991 \u2018Cyborg Manifesto\u2019 that people, since they are so often now detached and separated from nature, have themselves evolved into cyborgs. This striking idea has had considerable influence within critical theory, cultural studies and even science fiction (where it has surfaced, for example, in the Terminator films and in the Borg of the Star Trek franchise). But it is a notion that has had much less currency in theology. In his innovative new book, Scott Midson boldly argues that the deeper nuances of Haraway\u2019s and the cyborg idea can similarly rejuvenate theology, mythology and anthropology. Challenging the damaging anthropocentrism directed towards nature and the non-human in our society, the author reveals \u2013 through an imaginative reading of the myth of Eden \u2013 how it is now possible for humanity to be at one with the natural world even as it vigorously pursues novel, \u2018post-human\u2019, technologies.", "ISBN": "978-1-78672-295-9", "note": "Google-Books-ID: jixADwAAQBAJ", "shortTitle": "Cyborg Theology", "language": "en", "author": [{"family": "Midson", "given": "Scott A."}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2017", 10, 30]]}}
