How transformable are we? A proleptic model of the imago Dei signifies that a transformation is coming, that who we are as human beings is yet to be determined by our future. Of five theological models of the imago Dei\u2014(1) rationality; (2) morality; (3) relationality; (4) prolepsis; and (5) created co-creator\u2014the proleptic and co-creator models are particularly open to an alliance with technological transformation. However, even biological enhancement or intelligence amplification will not turn sinners into saints. Only divine grace can accomplish redemption; only divine grace can insure that we become who we truly are.", "URL": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2018.1488529", "DOI": "10.1080/14746700.2018.1488529", "ISSN": "1474-6700", "author": [{"family": "Peters", "given": "Ted"}], "issued": {"date-parts": [["2018", 7, 3]]}, "accessed": {"date-parts": [["2019", 1, 15]]}, "keyword": ["Technology"]}
